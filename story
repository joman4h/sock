"Beeeepp." The black machine in the corner of the bathroom is done waiting for you.
"Beepp beepp beeepp." 
You finally go to your bathroom with your basket ready to pick up your laundry.
You open the lid and immediatly, a flowery wood scent fills the place.
Your hands go into the lid reaching for clothes.
Damp jeans, your favourite hoodie, your heart drops.

The brown leather jacket. 
It’s sodden, the skin of it slick and ruined. 
You put it in there by mistake. 
Or maybe you didn't.
Maybe the room is just playing tricks on you again.

You find a sock, two, three...
There's somthing wrong. 

Calm down.
Your wet fingers reach the bottom, you sweep them across the metal.
Nothing.
You look at your basket and take out the still wet socks.
Here they are perfectly laid on the desk.
One black sock and it's pair. One beautiful blue sock with a lemon pattern.
Lonely and miserable. Your favourite pair has been seperated.
"Beeeepp."

The black machine in the corner of the bathroom sounds less like an appliance and more like a heart monitor flatlining. It’s done waiting.
